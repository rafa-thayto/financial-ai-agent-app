# 🤖 Agentic AI Features

This document outlines the enhanced agentic capabilities that transform the simple transaction extraction system into an intelligent financial assistant agent.

## 🧠 What Makes It Agentic?

The AI system now exhibits key characteristics of an intelligent agent:

### 1. **Contextual Awareness**

- **Memory**: Maintains conversation history and learns from past interactions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes spending patterns and identifies trends
- **Environmental Understanding**: Knows about budgets, spending habits, and financial goals

### 2. **Proactive Behavior**

- **Budget Monitoring**: Automatically alerts when approaching budget limits
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual spending patterns
- **Predictive Insights**: Suggests budgets based on historical data
- **Preventive Advice**: Warns about potential overspending

### 3. **Multi-Turn Conversations**

- **Clarification Questions**: Asks for more details when input is ambiguous
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Provides relevant next steps after transactions
- **Context Continuity**: Remembers previous conversation context

### 4. **Goal-Oriented Assistance**

- **Budget Optimization**: Suggests realistic budget amounts
- **Financial Health**: Provides insights on spending health
- **Behavioral Guidance**: Recommends financial habit improvements

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Database Schema

```sql
-- User preferences for personalization
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  key TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  value TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Budget tracking and alerts
CREATE TABLE budgets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount REAL NOT NULL,
  period TEXT CHECK (period IN ('monthly', 'weekly', 'yearly')),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Spending pattern analysis
CREATE TABLE spending_patterns (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  category TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  average_amount REAL NOT NULL,
  frequency REAL NOT NULL,
  last_updated TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Enhanced chat messages with context
ALTER TABLE chat_messages ADD COLUMN context TEXT;
```

### AI Agent Architecture

```typescript
class FinanceAIAgent {
  // Contextual awareness
  private async getContext(): Promise<AgentContext>;

  // Intelligent response generation
  async processMessage(message: string): Promise<AgentResponse>;

  // Proactive insights
  async generateProactiveInsights(): Promise<string[]>;

  // Budget suggestions
  async suggestBudgets(): Promise<BudgetSuggestion[]>;
}
```

## 🎯 Agent Response Types

The agent can now respond with different types of intelligence:

### 1. **Transaction Processing** (`type: "transaction"`)

- Extracts and records financial transactions
- Provides immediate feedback with contextual insights
- Updates spending patterns automatically

### 2. **Insights & Analysis** (`type: "insight"`)

- Analyzes spending trends and patterns
- Compares current vs. historical spending
- Identifies areas of concern or improvement

### 3. **Budget Alerts** (`type: "budget_alert"`)

- Monitors budget usage in real-time
- Warns when approaching limits (75%, 90%)
- Suggests budget adjustments based on patterns

### 4. **Proactive Suggestions** (`type: "suggestion"`)

- Recommends budget amounts for categories
- Suggests spending optimizations
- Provides financial planning advice

### 5. **Clarification Questions** (`type: "question"`)

- Asks for missing transaction details
- Seeks clarification on ambiguous inputs
- Guides users toward better financial tracking

## 💡 Intelligent Features

### Contextual Prompting

The agent builds rich context from:

- Recent transaction history
- Active budgets and spending against them
- Unusual spending patterns this month
- Previous conversation history
- User preferences and settings

### Pattern Learning

- **Spending Frequency**: Tracks how often you spend in each category
- **Average Amounts**: Learns typical spending amounts per category
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identifies monthly/weekly spending variations
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags spending that deviates >20% from patterns

### Proactive Monitoring

- **Budget Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of budget usage
- **Threshold Alerts**: Automatic warnings at 75% and 90% budget usage
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies increasing/decreasing spending trends
- **Predictive Budgeting**: Suggests budgets based on actual patterns

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Simple Transaction

```
User: "I spent $15 on lunch"
Agent: "Transaction recorded: -$15.00 for lunch (food)

💡 Your most frequent expense category is food (avg $35.10 per transaction).
📊 You're at 19.4% of your food budget. Consider monitoring closely."
```

### Ambiguous Input

```
User: "I bought something expensive"
Agent: "Could you provide more details? What did you buy, how much did it cost, and what category would it fall under? For example: 'I bought a laptop for $1200' or 'I spent $300 on clothes'."
```

### Spending Analysis

```
User: "How am I doing this month?"
Agent: "Here's your spending analysis:

📈 Your food spending is 120.8% higher than usual this month.
⚠️ You've spent 40.0% of your utilities budget this month!
💡 Your most frequent expense category is food (avg $35.10 per transaction).

Budget suggestions:
• transport: $54/month - Based on your average spending of $45.00 per transaction, 1.0 times per month."
```

### Budget Guidance

```
User: "Should I set a budget?"
Agent: "Based on your spending patterns, I recommend these budgets:

• food: $450/month - Based on your average spending of $35.10 per transaction, 0.3 times per month.
• transport: $54/month - Based on your average spending of $45.00 per transaction, 1.0 times per month.
• entertainment: $30/month - Based on your average spending of $25.00 per transaction, 1.0 times per month.

These include a 20% buffer above your typical spending."
```

## 🔄 Continuous Learning

The agent continuously improves through:

1. **Pattern Updates**: Recalculates spending patterns after each transaction
2. **Preference Learning**: Adapts to user preferences and feedback
3. **Context Building**: Builds richer context from conversation history
4. **Anomaly Refinement**: Improves anomaly detection based on user behavior

## 🎨 Enhanced UI Features

### Visual Intelligence Indicators

- **Agent Type Badges**: Transaction, Insight, Budget Alert, Suggestion, Question
- **Contextual Icons**: Different icons for different types of intelligence
- **Proactive Insights Panel**: Shows real-time insights at the top of chat
- **Suggestion Formatting**: Clearly formatted suggestions and recommendations

### Interactive Elements

- **Clarification Prompts**: Highlighted questions that need user response
- **Budget Status**: Visual indicators for budget health (🟢🟡🔴)
